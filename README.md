# NeverSnoozeAgain

## Inspiration
"5 more minutes Mom!" 
Waking up is hard and when you're supposed to study it is even harder.
**NeverSnoozeAgain** is a clever and innovative solution to force you to get your ass out of bed.
By limiting the time that you have to defuse the alarm, you really have to get up. 
Otherwise it will donate monaaay.
A lot of monaaayy.


## What it does
Set up an alarm using our android app at the time you want/have to wake up. 
To defuse the alarm, you can select different challenges that you have to complete within a configurable time limit.
If you don't manage to solve the challenges in time or you make a mistake, **NeverSnoozeAgain** will automatically transfer a pre-configured amount of money to a random charity organization.

## How we built it
The system is composed of a android application written in Kotlin.
The back-end is implemented as Google Cloud Platform in Golang.
The challenges are several wireless nodes build using an ESP8266.

## Challenges we ran into
We had to learn Kotlin.
We had to learn Golang.
We had to learn how to use Google Cloud Platform.
We had to design and build physical defuse challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
**NeverSnoozeAgain** employs a highly scalable and modular architecture.
It is absolutely unsnoozeable. Once the alarm goes of, you really have to get up and solve the challenges in time.


## What we learned
We learned Kotlin.
We learned Golang.
We learned how to use Google Cloud Platform.

## What's next for NeverSnoozeAgain
Tweaking and improving!
